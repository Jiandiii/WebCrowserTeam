In 2019, two Sydney siders came together with a shared passion for heavy, bassline driven house music. Over the course of 12 months, countless hours of experimentation in the studio brought Interupt to life. Their sound is characterised by a fusion of catchy melodies and hard-hitting basslines; a style that's quickly gaining traction. Their bootleg refresh of the classic dance anthem, “Show Me Love”, has racked up over 100,000 plays alone. After releasing their first track with international label Crucast, they gained support from international artists, including Skepsis, TS7 & Notion. With their first original single, "Think About Me", signed to renowned dance music label, TMRW Music, Interupt is proving that their unique sound is worth all the attention it receives.
